# 🔄 Device Lifecycle Management (DLM) System

## 📋 Overview

This comprehensive Device Lifecycle Management system transforms raw inventory data into actionable risk-based device replacement recommendations. The system consists of two main components that work together to provide complete data analysis and risk assessment for IT asset management.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Clean and validate** messy inventory data
- **Analyze device age, brand reliability, and category criticality**
- **Generate risk-based replacement schedules**
- **Provide color-coded Excel reports** for easy decision-making
- **Support data-driven IT budget planning**

## 🚀 Stage 1: Data Cleaning & Validation

### **File:** `device_analyzer_with_categories.py`

### **What It Does:**
1. **Loads raw CSV inventory data** (handles encoding issues)
2. **Normalizes brand names** (fixes spelling, case, variations)
3. **Normalizes categories** (standardizes device types)
4. **Validates purchase dates** (identifies invalid/future/too-old dates)
5. **Calculates device ages** (in years)
6. **Separates valid vs invalid data** (for quality analysis)
7. **Generates color-coded Excel reports**

### **Data Quality Features:**
- **Brand Normalization:**
  - Fixes common misspellings (`epsson` → `epson`)
  - Standardizes variations (`hewlett packard` → `hp`)
  - Removes hyphens and underscores

- **Category Normalization:**
  - Fixes spelling errors (`defibulator` → `defibrillator`)
  - Standardizes naming (`pc desktop` → `desktop`)

- **Purchase Date Validation:**
  - 🔴 **Too Old:** Before 2010
  - 🔴 **Future Date:** After current date
  - 🔴 **Invalid Format:** Unparseable dates
  - 🔴 **Missing:** Empty fields
  - 🟢 **Valid:** Reasonable dates with calculated age

### **Excel Output Sheets:**
1. **Original_Data** - Raw unprocessed data
2. **All_Brands_Recognized** - Devices with valid brands
3. **Brands_Unrecognized** - Devices needing brand cleanup
4. **All_Categories_Recognized** - Devices with valid categories
5. **Categories_Unrecognized** - Devices needing category assignment
6. **Valid_Purchase_Dates** - Devices with valid dates & age analysis
7. **Invalid_Purchase_Dates** - Devices needing date correction
8. **Fully_Valid_Data** - ⭐ **Perfect data for lifecycle analysis**
9. **All_Invalid_Data** - All problematic devices with issue explanations
10. **Data_Quality_Summary** - Executive dashboard with statistics

### **Usage:**
```python
python device_analyzer_with_categories.py
```

**Input Required:** 
- CSV file at: `C:\Users\AbrehamMesfin\Downloads\Inventory.csv`

**Output Generated:**

## 🎯 Stage 2: Risk Analysis & Lifecycle Management

### **File:** `device_lifecycle_risk_analyzer.py`

### **What It Does:**
1. **Reads the "Fully_Valid_Data" sheet** from Stage 1
2. **Calculates risk scores** using 3-factor weighted system
3. **Classifies devices** into HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk categories
4. **Generates replacement schedules** with timelines
5. **Creates detailed analysis reports** with insights
6. **Provides color-coded Excel dashboards**

### **Risk Scoring System (100-Point Scale):**

#### **🕐 Device Age Risk (50 points max - MOST IMPORTANT)**
| Age Range | Risk Score | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------|
| 5+ years | 50 points | 🔴 High Risk | Immediate replacement |
| 3-5 years | 25 points | 🟡 Medium Risk | Plan replacement |
| <3 years | 5 points | 🟢 Low Risk | Continue monitoring |

**Why Age Matters Most:**
- Hardware failure rates increase exponentially with age
- Performance degradation impacts productivity
- Security vulnerabilities in older systems
- Repair costs exceed replacement value

#### **🏷️ Brand Reliability Risk (30 points max - IMPORTANT)**
| Brand Tier | Examples | Risk Score | Rationale |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Tier 1: Enterprise** | HP, Dell, Lenovo, Apple, Cisco | 5 points | Excellent support, proven reliability |
| **Tier 2: Consumer** | Acer, ASUS, Logitech, Netgear | 15 points | Good products, limited enterprise support |
| **Tier 3: Unknown** | Lesser-known brands | 25 points | Unknown reliability, limited support |

**Note:** *Brand classifications are based on general industry knowledge and can be customized based on your organization's experience.*

#### **📂 Device Category Risk (20 points max - MODERATE)**
| Category Type | Examples | Risk Score | Business Impact |
|---------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Critical Infrastructure** | Servers, Network Equipment, Medical Devices | 20 points | Organization-wide impact |
| **Business Essential** | Desktops, Laptops, Printers, Monitors | 10 points | Individual productivity impact |
| **Standard Equipment** | Tablets, Phones, Accessories | 3 points | Minimal business disruption |

### **Risk Classification:**
- **🔴 HIGH RISK (70-100 points):** IMMEDIATE replacement (next 6 months)
- **🟡 MEDIUM RISK (35-69 points):** PLANNED replacement (6-18 months)
- **🟢 LOW RISK (0-34 points):** SCHEDULED replacement (18+ months)

### **Excel Output Sheets:**
1. **Complete_Risk_Analysis** - All devices ranked by risk score
2. **Risk_Summary_Dashboard** - Executive overview with percentages
3. **Brand_Risk_Analysis** - Most problematic brands identified
4. **Category_Risk_Analysis** - Device types needing attention
5. **Age_Distribution_Analysis** - Age-based risk breakdown
6. **HIGH_RISK_Devices** - 🔴 Critical devices needing immediate action
7. **MEDIUM_RISK_Devices** - 🟡 Devices for planned replacement
8. **LOW_RISK_Devices** - 🟢 Devices in good condition

### **Usage:**
```python
python device_lifecycle_risk_analyzer.py
```

**Input Required:** 
- Excel file from Stage 1: `C:\Users\AbrehamMesfin\Downloads\device_analysis_with_categories.xlsx`

**Output Generated:** 
- Risk analysis Excel: `C:\Users\AbrehamMesfin\Downloads\device_lifecycle_risk_analysis.xlsx`
